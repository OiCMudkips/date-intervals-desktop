# date-intervals-desktop
This is a C# desktop app which generates a list of dates based on:

* The start date of the list of dates.
* The number of dates to include in the list.
* The number of days between each date in the list.

## Building

This app currently targets .NET 4.6.1 but there isn't any reason that I'm aware of that would restrict anyone from changing the framework version. You should just need to build the solution and the output executable will be placed in the default build directory for the solution in Visual Studio.
